283,2021,OH,City of Cleveland,Severe weather events,Less serious,"In Cleveland, we have not only witnessed increased precipitation over the last few decades, but also heavier rains. Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA."
284,2021,OH,City of Cleveland,Declining water quality,Less serious,"While Cleveland has seen incredible improvement in water quality over the last several decades, increases in precipitation and stormwater runoff pose a significant threat to water quality in the region. As noted above, increases in precipitation have led  to more flooding, combined sewer overflows, and delays in the planting of spring crops, which in turn have resulted in declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs. Some of this is the result of harmful algal blooms forming in the Western basin of Lake Erie, which may have impacts in the Cleveland region if they become too large."

Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or ""banked"" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been ""banked"" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.

31,2018,CA,Culver City,Increased water stress or scarcity,Serious,"From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of fresh water. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%.  Through the Cityâ€™s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City was able to reduce its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life.  A report issued in February 2018 by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, showed that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought."

These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for storm water runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution."

Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. This may lead to more flooding, delays in the planting of spring crops, and declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs."
14,2017,OH,Cleveland,Increased water stress or scarcity,Serious,"Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA."

As a result, storm sewers that are at or above capacity may experience more frequent and intense interior flooding. Additionally, the stormwater and combined sewer outfalls that discharge to the Potomac and Anacostia rivers are at low elevations compared to mean sea level. As a result, they will also be susceptible to flooding from sea level rise and storm surge “backing up” through the piped infrastructure which could cause additional flooding in low lying areas."
