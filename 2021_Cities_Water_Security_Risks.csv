These aqueducts transport potable water from the Lake District through Cumbria, Lancashire and south to Greater Manchester. It also provides critical support to the south of the zone and can be used to offset supply from the River Dee and Lake Vyrnwy, including during an outage event if we experienced contamination in the River Dee.The long distance aqueducts that supply Manchester have been the subject of investigation and refurbishment since the 1990s. Considerable planning and investment in enabling works was required to complete a 4 week outage of a 109 km potable water supply aqueduct commissioned in the 1950s. The findings from this outage investigation, completed in the winter of 2016, indicate that there are a number of risks that could affect the resilience of service to customers. These risks arise mainly from degradation of concrete lined tunnel sections of the aqueduct. The Manchester and Pennine Resilience risk could, in the future, result in a widespread water quality incident or loss of supply to many thousands of properties for an extended period. United Utilities have carried out extensive risk analysis covering a range of failure modes and consequences, with the risk increasing as the asset ages and deteriorates over the coming years. For the purposes of customer research and consultation we have simplified this into three indicative events to represent the overall baseline system risk over a future 10 year period: • 65% probability that 1.2 million properties could be affected by water quality problems for at least one week • 35% probability that 120,000 properties could be affected by supply interruptions for up to three months • 10% probability that 240,000 properties could be affected by supply interruptions for up to two weeks These represent the baseline risk in the absence of any options which are discussed in the following sections.

As we grow our urban forest, water demand is projected to increase to maintain the health of new and existing trees under more regular drought conditions  To meet this demand we have developed and begun to implement a 10-year stormwater harvesting plan, resulting in the use of fit-for-purpose water to irrigate and cool our parks and gardens. We currently have the capacity to provide up to 25 per cent of our irrigation demand from non-potable, alternative water sources including rainwater and stormwater harvesting. This reduces our reliance on drinking water which becomes more important as the city’s population grows and experiences the impacts of climate change."

The PWD maintains a 1,000-mile network of water mains ranging from 60 inches to 2 inches, pump stations, and reservoirs that bring water from Sebago Lake to Portland homes and businesses. A comprehensive water main renewal program and flushing program ensure clean and fresh water. Large water mains, transmission mains, extend from the treatment facility to Westbrook and Portland. As with the whole distribution system, redundancy is maintained to ensure minimum interruptions in water service. Roughly 25 million gallons of water is kept in storage. This helps maintain proper pressure, and it allows for a water reserve in case of an emergency, like a fire or a flood.Fire protection is a very important focus within the water distribution system. In fact, public water flowed from Sebago Lake over 100 years ago after devastating fires in Portland. After that, people realized that private wells were no longer sufficient for fire protection, or the increasing water demands in the Greater Portland area. Because fire protection is so important, the 5,000 hydrants the District owns are regularly tested and cleaned to ensure they are operating correctly.This is a large amount of infrastructure that will continue aging and will continue to need cleaning, repairs, and eventually replacement.

Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA."

Conforme estudos publicados, a escassez provocada pelo aumento da estiagem no Nordeste do Brasil pode levar a população à recorrer a serviços de furo de poços tubulares de uso privado. Um dos principais problemas dos poços privados é que muitos se tornam salinizados e são perdidos e abandonados. Uma das prováveis causas da salinização é a intrusão de águas salinas do mar induzida pelo bombeamento desordenado. O bombeamento dos poços faz com que as águas salgadas de canais e estuários, além de paleomangues (sedimentos que tiveram contato com águas salgadas, quando o nível do mar era mais alto), penetrem no aquífero, provocando sua salinização. Uma vez salinizados os poços e o aquífero há pouco o que fazer. As tecnologias de dessalinização são limitadas e os sistemas de tratamento individual de água salgada de poços são muito caros. É possível observarmos o aumento da procura por esses serviços sempre que status quo vai modificar a dinâmica da gestão hídrica da cidade. Fonte: COSTA, M. R. de. et al.

Assim, assume-se haver capacidade de adaptação nas pessoas com melhores condições financeiras, que poderiam ter acesso a fontes “particulares” de acesso à água, como por exemplo, na compra de caminhões pipa, não sendo dependentes do sistema público. Observa-se que há um aumento da intensidade de ameaça entre a base histórica e o cenário projetado.

An unprecedented series of storm events in Auckland in March and April 2017 caused significant slips in the water catchments, bringing the turbidity of water in most water supply dams to 100 to 8,000 times their normal levels. This affected Auckland’s water supply significantly and for the first time in 23 years, Aucklanders were asked to reduce their water consumption. The crisis was managed without mandatory restrictions or damage to the infrastructure, thanks to the overwhelming positive community response to the water savings campaign. At Watercare, this event triggered work on system resilience and climate change strategy. The national climate and weather experts have called these storm events “off the chart”, well beyond the 1 in 100 year storm events the water systems have been designed for."

The risk of infection also increases in the later parts of the water supply chain. At higher water temperatures, it will probably be easier for different pathogens to grow, which will require a more extensive purification of the raw water. Warmer summers can also cause new waterborne, pathogenic microorganisms to establish themselves in Malmö's water sources. the water plants producing Malmö’s drinking water have diffrent combinatins of the following treatment steps: Aeration, filtration, softening, UV, infiltrated surface water, chlorination, chemical precipitation, sedimentation. The concentrations of chlorine used in Sweden basically do not work on parasites and have little efficiency on viruses. Other disinfectants are also present, such as UV light which can reduce parasites, and ozone, however, is not effective against all microorganisms. However, since the timescale is long-term, there will be time to adapt the purification process to these changes."

Electric power is needed at everything from groundwater pumps, surface water intake and purification equipment in the waterworks to the pipeline network's pressure boosting stations. Sewer pipes and water pipes are usually co-fired, usually with the sewer line at the bottom. At high groundwater levels, leaking sewage water can penetrate into the water pipe if the water pipe is pressureless. This can happen if the power supply is simultaneously disabled. Electricity supply and spare parts are therefore an important prerequisite for safe drinking water distribution. Problems with the power supply during thunderstorms are common already today and there is a risk in the future to steer control and control systems to a greater extent.The plants that supply Malmö with water are equipped with backup power, and are planning to build solar panels for additional backup, so for short-time power failure there shouldn't be a problem. However, in the event of a prolonged loss of electricity, water distribution is affected just like the rest of society."

Purpose for water use in addition to drinking water is, for example, industry, energy and irrigation. Conflicts of interest regarding surface water resources can occur when there is low water flow during the summer season in combination with drought.

Water Security,Water Supply,14.2a,Please identify the risks to your city’s water security as well as the timescale and level of risk.,1,Drought,Medium-term (by 2050),Serious,Medium-low,"Model projections show, with high agreement among models, that overall drought stress is expected to increase in Louisville, even as average precipitation increases by 9%, on average. Because of much higher temperatures projected for the area, a modest increase in precipitation is not sufficient for offsetting higher evaporation and evapotranspiration rates.Over time, the deficit in moisture (negative balance between the amount of precipitation and the amount of water used within the natural system) is expected to increase. With continued higher emissions (RCP 8.5) drought stress is expected to increase 10-18% (14% on average) by the middle of this century. By late century, drought stress is expected to increase 10-21% (16% on average). If emissions are reduced (RCP 4.5), drought stress can be limited to 12-13%, on average, by mid to late-century. Some of the biggest impacts of drought are to water quality, with warmer surface waters and lower flows. These can cause challenges to the cost and implications of water treatment, as well as risk to water supplies, public health, and aquatic ecosystems. Decreases in volume can cause high temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen levels, both of which affect aquatic life. When nutrient loading is added to the mix, harmful algal blooms can further threaten waterways and water supplies.Based on the best available scientific information and trends, it is highly likely that drought risk will worsen in Louisville, driven primarily by increasing temperatures, and even if precipitation increases as well. The geographic distribution of this risk is not expected to change (from that presented in the HMP) with climate change, but the severity could increase. This risk could be lessened if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.(From Climate  Hazards Addendum to Louisville Metro Hazard Mitigation Plan)"

There are no major insect and disease outbreaks of concern as yet, but over time tree mortality and any spread in introduced invasive shrubs present in the area, will increase forest fuel loadings.  Higher amounts of forest fuels, combined with an increase in temperature and evaporation during the summer months, increases the likelihood of wildfire spread if there is an ignition.   In response to these threats, forest health is monitored annually, there is a program of forest fuel management in place, and an assessment of the potential for forest management to reduce drought stress and vulnerability to insect species of concern.  There is also a well-established and resourced program of wildfire prevention, preparedness, detection, and suppression and plans and materials are in place to minimize the potential for sediment and debris flow issues of a fire occurs.

As alterações climáticas podem também aumentar orisco de propagação de doenças transmitidas pela água, sobretudo em zonas da cidade de Braga onde as condiçõessanitárias são mais deficientes.Para além da elevação da temperatura, a modificação do regime de precipitações associado àsalterações climáticas pode também ter impactos sobre a qualidade da água. Precipitações maisintensas provocam caudais de cheia mais elevados, os quais, por sua vez, podem ser causa de umadegradação da qualidade da água devido ao transporte pelos cursos de água de maiores quantidadesde sedimentos em suspensão, nutrientes e agentes patogénicos. Nas zonas do território com maior atividadeagrícola, o maior escoamento superficial tenderá também a aumentar a concentração de fertilizantese pesticidas nalguns troços dos cursos de água, caso não sejam tomadas medidas de controlo destefenómeno.Precipitações mais intensas podem também aumentar a pressão sobre os sistemas de evacuação deáguas residuais, o que pode ocasionar o extravasamento dos sistemas de drenagem e assimfavorecer a propagação de doenças, especialmente se a temperatura ambiente for elevada. A redução da quantidade de água em resultado das alterações climáticas contribuirá ainda parareduzir a capacidade de autodepuração dos cursos de água relativamente às cargas poluentes dosefluentes neles rejeitados.

There are no major insect and disease outbreaks of concern as yet, but over time tree mortality and any spread in introduced invasive shrubs present in the area, will increase forest fuel loadings.  Higher amounts of forest fuels, combined with an increase in temperature and evaporation during the summer months, increases the likelihood of wildfire spread if there is an ignition.   In response to these threats, forest health is monitored annually, there is a program of forest fuel management in place, and an assessment of the potential for forest management to reduce drought stress and vulnerability to insect species of concern.  There is also a well-established and resourced program of wildfire prevention, preparedness, detection, and suppression and plans and materials are in place to minimize the potential for sediment and debris flow issues of a fire occurs.

Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life.

Concreted or built-up areas are zones with the least amount of infiltration due to the inability of surface water to penetrate concrete. Areas with rich vegetation allow high amount of infiltration due to the roots of these plants loosen the overlaying rocks and soil making it easier for water to penetrate towards the water table. Also, the amount of foliage of vegetation affect recharge potential. Areas with thick foliage provide a buffer for rain water due to droplets being intercepted by plant leaves. Thus, the underlying soil is provided with more time to soak up the rainfall. Furthermore, vegetation with a large area coverage prevents the direct evaporation of water from the soil. Areas of low infiltration are mostly concentrated in the south and east of the city; in the downtown area, near barangays Dita and Curuan and rivers adjacent to Vitali island barangay."

There are not only breaks in the piping system but also probably a high level of water theft is going on. The cost of Narmada water supply has always been high and so from the beginning there have been under recoveries as the consumers have been subsidised. The State Government has been providing grants to somehow keep the system running but this has resulted in poor maintenance of the system and with age it has deteriorated. The first phase of the system is close to 40 years old and the second phase is more than 20 years old. The distribution system is of 1931 vintage in parts. The later additions to the distribution system have been in an unplanned and haphazard manner and this has led to the pressure distribution in the pipeline going awry. Especially the addition of overhead tanks without a properly redesigned and laid out distribution system has put pressure on the existing pipelines and there are frequent outages. Moreover water meters have not been installed to keep a tab on the water being supplied and so there is no way in which to monitor the losses and the reasons for them.

The cost of electricity also is going up in leaps and bounds because there is pressure on the electricity generation and distribution companies to recover costs. The accumulated losses of all the government companies involved in distribution of electricity in Madhya Pradesh was more than Rs 12000 crores in 2011 (Dixit 3). Whereas the price of high tension power required for the Narmada pumping has gone up from Rs 3.68 per unit to Rs 5.13 per unit in 2011, it has gone up from Rs 3.42 per unit to Rs 4.47 per unit for low tension power used for tubewells (HT Live VIII 1). This will further increase the financial unsustainability of the Narmada water supply system. The start of the first phase of 90 MLD of the new Narmada supply funded by the ADB loan was in fact held up due to the power distribution company refusing to provide power unless an advance payment of Rs 10 crore was made. Eventually the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission ruled that the outstanding dues on the earlier phases could not be advanced as an excuse for demanding such a high advance for starting the third phase and so the water supply started (HT Live IX 1)."

Instead private parties have indiscriminately exploited the ground water reserves for commercial supply. Neither have any serious steps been taken by the IMC to ensure recharge of water. The cheapest sources of supply are the Yashwant Sagar and Bilawli reservoirs. The possibilities of building a few more such reservoirs in the rural areas of Indore have not been explored at all. Instead there has been a proliferation of tubewells which draw water from the deep aquifer at 200 metres or more depth to supply water commercially through tankers at rates which are currently about Rs 70 for 1000 litres (HT Live X 1).

The Council has introduced water efficiency standards for all new development, although we are limited in the standards that can be set for new housing as a result of national planning policy. Further work carried out to support work on the Greater Cambridge Local Plan has shown that there is no capacity to increase groundwater abstraction from the chalk aquifer.  Future water demand will need to be balanced in other ways including greater water efficiency in new developments along with measures by the water companies such as reducing leaks and shifting to more sustainable water sources.  Longer term solutions will include major new regional water supply reservoirs, transfer schemes and land use change.  These options are all being explored and assessed by Water Resources East as they develop their Regional Plan for water management across eastern England."

These are: The Rimac River Basin, Lurin and Chillon. The average flow of each basin is 25.8, 4.61 and 2.85 m3/s respectively. These average flows can be affected by many meteorological and climatic factors, one of them is that climate change is causing rainfall in the upper parts of each basin to vary causing a decrease in rationalization in some of the 43 districts of the City of Lima. However, the rains in the Peruvian Andes cause sludge slides, which alter the quality of the water, making it unsafe for human consumption and its treatment involves increased costs in the purchase of chemicals and advanced machinery.Another of the main points to mention is that on the banks of each river there are activities related to metallic and non-metallic informal mining whose waste generated in them seriously endangers the quality of the water. These mostly passive environmental mining wastes located on riverbanks put water quality at risk. It is for this reason that the Ministry of the Environment together with the National Water Authority and the Drinking Water and Sewerage Service are carrying out different prevention measures to ensure the supply of quality water for the City of Lima and its 43 districts."

More than half of the Sierra Nevada snowpack may be lost by the end of the century (Reich et al., 2018). Snowpack may dwindle or nearly disappear during droughts (Berg & Hall, 2017). Additionally, seasonal shifts associated with climate change may cause snow to melt earlier in the season, which can be particularly problematic for imported water supply.Runoff from early snowmelt is not as easily conserved in reservoirs and is therefore unable to be used to meet summer demand (Wang et al., 2018). The availability of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed (via the SWP and the CVP) and from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (via the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission) is dependent on snowpack.

En el curso de ambos ríos existen sistemas de embalses que, además de posibilitar la producción de hidroelectricidad, actúan como elementos de regulación de caudales. En el río Diamante, cuyo módulo es de 36.8 m3/s, se encuentra el sistema conformado por los diques:-Agua de Toro (376 hm3), Los Reyunos (255hm3) y El Tigre (7 hm3) En el río Atuel, de módulo 34,7 m3/s, los diques:-El Nihuil (356 hm3) y Valle Grande (168 hm3). El primero de ellos produce la recarga principal de la cuenca, que es del orden de los 130 hm3/año en zona de acuífero libre. El aporte del río Atuel, al ingresar a la cuenca es de escasa magnitud y en la mayoría de su recorrido se comporta como efluente captando aguas freáticas y desagües de la cuenca. Anualmente se realizan evaluaciones de riesgo de los mismos sobre dos hipótesis posibles, la ruptura simple y la ruptura en cascada, donde los volúmenes erogados variarían entre los 250 metros cúbicos y los 600 metros cúbicos, de acuerdo con las estimaciones de las empresas HINISA (Hidroeléctrica Nihuil Sociedad Anónima) e HIDISA (Hidroeléctrica Diamante Sociedad Anónima), concesionarias de los sistemas, la recurrencia de un posible incidente de menor gravedad se podría presentar entre los 50/100 años, mientras que no hay estimación posible para un incidente mayor. Otra de las variantes que presentan los eventos adversos con origen hídrico, son los anegamientos de sectores bajos de nuestro departamento y que tienen como causa las lluvias estivales. Las mismas provocan el colapso de los sistemas de desagüe pluvial urbano y agrícola y además el mal funcionamiento de los sistemas de tratamiento de aguas domiciliarios debiendo en algunos casos evacuar a las familias afectadas. Desde hace unas décadas otro evento a considerar, aunque de progreso más lento que los anteriores pero de consecuencias importantes en la población regional, es el avance de la desertificación y las variaciones en su capacidad de contención de las napas de aguas subterráneas. Estas problemáticas son percibidas por nuestras comunidades aunque aún no han sido evaluadas en cuanto al duro impacto que viene provocando y a la severidad con la que se presentaran en el mediano y largo plazo."

Not only will the warmer atmosphere be able to hold more water leading to less precipitation in the Southwest, especially in warm months, but also longer and more severe droughts as storm tracks shift northward leaving already arid climates even dryer. Additionally, with the climate warming, Boulder County is expecting to have more rain and less snow. This is a critical change because Boulder County depends on the gradual melting of snowpack to supply surface water through the warm months. More rain and less snow meas lower flows and greater water stress in summer. I think this description fits better in Row 1.

These waters will continue to require more and more filtration with additional sediment and processing of pollutants to provide clean water to municipal and agricultural lands. Boulder County also is expecting water temperature to affect water quality. This will lead to lower levels of dissolved oxygen in water which creates more stress on the fish and insects that rely on oxygen.

The report emphasised that cooperation between the Palestinian Authority, Israel and Egypt is vital if an epidemic is to be pre-empted.The main causes of the water and sanitation crisis are the depletion and poor quality of Gaza’s single coastal aquifer, which is the source of 95 per cent of all water in Gaza. Until the 1990s the aquifer provided Gaza Strip inhabitants with drinkable tap water. Today 97 per cent of this water is unfit for human consumption based on World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The primary driver of contamination of the aquifer is the longstanding over-extraction of almost three times more water than is naturally replenished by rainfall.[3] This practice results in increasing intrusion of seawater. The sea also flushes back to the shores of Gaza large amounts of untreated or insufficiently treated sewage that is dumped into the sea, mainly due to the energy crisis.[4] Open sewage runoff and agrichemicals also seep into the aquifer."

Water Security,Water Supply,14.2a,Please identify the risks to your city’s water security as well as the timescale and level of risk.,2,Declining water quality,,,,"The longstanding water and sanitation crisis affecting Gaza requires massive infrastructural investment, a sustainable solution to the energy crisis, the lifting of access restrictions and political solutions, both internally and with Israel.The fact that an epidemic has not yet occurred is due mainly to mitigating humanitarian responses, including WASH projects focused on ensuring clean drinking water, preventing raw sewage from overflowing into the streets and some treatment of wastewater; the supply of emergency fuel to operate essential facilities and services; and projects such as vaccinations delivered via UNRWA to some 77 per cent of the population in Gaza who are registered as Palestine refugees.However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to mitigate the impact of the water and sanitation crisis. At a time of increased need, funding for the oPt is at an all-time low. By October, only US$197.7 million had been secured of a requested $539.7 million for the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), i.e a mere 36 per cent. The situation regarding interventions by the WASH cluster is even worse: only 21.7 per cent of $45.5 million in funding required for responses in 2018 has been so far provided.[10] In fact, nearly all agencies requesting funding through the HRP have received less funding in 2018 than in previous years, including UNRWA whose operations have been undermined by the US government ceasing its financial support to the Agency.[11]Lack of funding for lifesaving humanitarian responses has been challenged further by the electricity crisis. This has diverted funds for emergency fuel to operate backup generators and forced other components of planned WASH humanitarian responses to be put on hold.Humanitarian interventions planned by the WASH cluster for 2019, assuming the availability of essential funds and energy, include the establishment, extension or rehabilitation of water distribution and sanitation systems and infrastructures; improvements to WASH facilities in key service institutions; supplying households without sanitation facilities to end open defecation and ensure access to at least basic sanitation; and providing WASH facilities with emergency power requirements (fuel and/or renewable energy), equipment and maintenance to enable lifesaving operations to continue.[12]"

In 2009, UNICEF reported that 12 per cent of deaths in children and infants were caused by diarrhoea. In 2011, 26 per cent of all childhood diseases in Gaza were identified by UNICEF as waterborne.[13] In 2016, poor water quality and access to water contributed to over a quarter of all reported diseases in Gaza, according to WHO.[14] In the same year, the Palestinian Ministry of Health identified several diseases stemming from poor personal hygiene[15], including acute hepatitis A, typhoid fever and acute diarrhoea. These diseases can jeopardize the nutritional status of newborns and infants, and may lead to stunting and developmental delay.  In 2016, viral meningitis was identified as the most common infectious disease observed in children in Gaza; recurrent outbreaks in 1997, 2004 and 2013 disproportionally affected children and infants on each occasion. Although the causes of this disease can vary, it is apt to spread faster in areas with a poor water supply and poor personal hygiene. It is estimated that difficulties in epidemiological data collection may mask more severe public health effects emerging from the water and wastewater crisis."
