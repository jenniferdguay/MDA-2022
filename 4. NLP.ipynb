    "Recall in section 2.2 Data Visualisuation, we found that California faced the greatest threat to water supply from 2017 to 2021. Therefore, we might be further interested in studying the risk descriptions of the water supply risk for California, compared to the rest of the US (**NB**: this was not included in our predefined research questions). Specifically, we'd like to know how California is different than the other states, since it was highlighted as having the greatest threat across 2017, 2018 and 2021. \n",

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "      <td>In Cleveland, we have not only witnessed increased precipitation over the last few decades, but also heavier rains. Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA.While Cleveland has seen incredible improvement in water quality over the last several decades, increases in precipitation and stormwater runoff pose a significant threat to water quality in the region. As noted above, increases in precipitation have led  to more flooding, combined sewer overflows, and delays in the planting of spring crops, which in turn have resulted in declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs. Some of this is the result of harmful algal blooms forming in the Western basin of Lake Erie, which may have impacts in the Cleveland region if they become too large.Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland.

       "CA     Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",

but also heavier rains. Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA.While Cleveland has seen incredible improvement in water quality over the last several decades, increases in precipitation and stormwater runoff pose a significant threat to water quality in the region. As noted above, increases in precipitation have led  to more flooding, combined sewer overflows, and delays in the planting of spring crops, which in turn have resulted in declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs. Some of this is the result of harmful algal blooms forming in the Western basin of Lake Erie, which may have impacts in the Cleveland region if they become too large.Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland.

       "CA    Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts\n",

but also heavier rains. Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA.While Cleveland has seen incredible improvement in water quality over the last several decades, increases in precipitation and stormwater runoff pose a significant threat to water quality in the region. As noted above, increases in precipitation have led  to more flooding, combined sewer overflows, and delays in the planting of spring crops, which in turn have resulted in declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs. Some of this is the result of harmful algal blooms forming in the Western basin of Lake Erie, which may have impacts in the Cleveland region if they become too large.Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland.

Southern Nevada Water Authority officials have also been studying and have water rights in Eastern Nevada and will develop a groundwater importation project (pipeline) in the event water levels continue to decline.Water costs are higher due to infrastructure charges used to pay for new water projects, such as the third intake at Lake Mead. Even with conservation efforts, water costs have increased.Water restrictions have led to more conservation; however, if Lake Mead continues to decline, a Federally mandated cut in Southern Nevada's water allocation may occur, and nearly did during the 2015-2016.The City is currently experiencing a 20 year drought. According to climate scientists and SNWA, there is an 80 to 90 percentchance there will be another mutli-decade drought this century due to climate change. This hazard has the immediate effect of a shortfall of water supplies across all Colorado River water users; the long-term effect will also be economic and environmentalDue to the drought, there is less hydro capacity and generation at Hoover and Davis Dams as a result of lower water supplies.SNWA has a finite allotment of water from the Colorado River that is taken from Lake Mead. The level of water in Lake Mead fluctuates with snowfall in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming. Per the Drought Status Update for California-Nevada | Drought.gov reports as of March 2021, Nevada is in “moderate-to-exceptional drought” and “In Nevada, 100% of the state is in drought, and 40% is in exceptional drought (D4), more area than at any point during the 2012-2016 drought.”  The City of Henderson is in the D4 area. The Lake Mead level is currently trending lower than the previous two years.Risk is mitigated by promoting water conservation, creation and adoption of a regional water resource plan (out to 2050), and active participation by SNWA in interstate discussions regarding the future state of the Colorado River System.Our water source, Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, is a high-profile national recreation area. Terrorism or an accidental pollution incident would greatly jeopardize our water supply.

stormwater collection system may be exposed to more extreme and frequent flooding due to the predicted increase in heavy precipitation events, as well as inundation from sea level rise and storm surge. As a result, storm sewers that are at or above capacity may experience more frequent and intense interior flooding. Additionally, the stormwater and combined sewer outfalls that discharge to the Potomac and Anacostia rivers are at low elevations compared to mean sea level. As a result, they will also be susceptible to flooding from sea level rise and storm surge “backing up” through the piped infrastructure which could cause additional flooding in low lying areas.The District's Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment reports that the Districtâ€™s stormwater collection system may be exposed to more extreme and frequent flooding due to the predicted increase in heavy precipitation events, as well as inundation from sea level rise and storm surge.

It is anticipated that drought events will continue in the future and be further exacerbated by climate change. An ongoing reduction in snow pack due to higher average temperatures, which is the primary source of water supply for our region, is a newer risk. Climate models do not agree on the impacts to precipitation, but not having an adequate level of snow is likely to be a substantive challenge in the coming decades.Historically, the Fort Collins water supply has been at risk from wildfire and the often associated flooding. It is anticipated that these types of events will continue in the future and be further exacerbated by climate change.Flooding or runoff from peak rain events canimpact water quality and potentially limit theability to treat drinking water, as evidenced bythe 2013 flood.  Short-term impacts from the flood included increased debris and sediment in Boulder Reservoir, elevatedturbidity levels, and increased concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll a, total organic carbon, andbacteria. Two years’ post-flood, Boulder Reservoir alkalinity, hardness and other water chemistryparameters remained elevated, though concentrations have been returning to pre-flood conditions.Listed 303(d) river and many in similar mountain resort communities and urban areas.Although Longmont currently has secure water rights, we are carefully watching the impacts of climate change on our water supply.Climate change has snow pack and snow melts varying at unpredictable rates not allowing sufficient predictability to help in planning for crop selection and storage projects.Drought increases stress on our water supply and also encourages wildfires throughout the county which contributes to sediment runoff and natural watershed filtration.Flooding, wildfires, and drought are Boulder County's main concerns with severe weather events. The county is decided how much resources to put towards resiliency in preparing for extreme weather events as well as emergency planning for when then events do occur.The water treatment facility is susceptible to power outages that could affect water management.Listed 303(d) river and many in similar mountain resort communities and urban areas.\n",

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "0  Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2016-2017, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "0  Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",

    "**Lemmetisation** and **stemming** both finds the root form of an inflected word, but unlike **stemming** it takes into account the knowledge of the context and therefore can better discriminate between words which have meanings depending on part-of-speech (POS). While **lemmitisation** generally is computationally slowler than **stemming**, it produces more accurate results. Therefore, we will will use lemmatisation to reduce related forms of a word to a common base form. For this we will use the ````WordNet```` corpus from **NTLK** library. **NLTK** also provides ```WordNetLemmatizer``` function that uses the ```WordNet``` to lookup lemmas of words."

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "0  Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2016-2017, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2016-2017, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "0  Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water.

       "0  Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "      <td>In Cleveland, we have not only witnessed increased precipitation over the last few decades, but also heavier rains. Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA.While Cleveland has seen incredible improvement in water quality over the last several decades, increases in precipitation and stormwater runoff pose a significant threat to water quality in the region. As noted above, increases in precipitation have led  to more flooding, combined sewer overflows, and delays in the planting of spring crops, which in turn have resulted in declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs. Some of this is the result of harmful algal blooms forming in the Western basin of Lake Erie, which may have impacts in the Cleveland region if they become too large.Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland.

According to climate scientists and SNWA, there is an 80 to 90 percentchance there will be another mutli-decade drought this century due to climate change. This hazard has the immediate effect of a shortfall of water supplies across all Colorado River water users; the long-term effect will also be economic and environmentalDue to the drought, there is less hydro capacity and generation at Hoover and Davis Dams as a result of lower water supplies.SNWA has a finite allotment of water from the Colorado River that is taken from Lake Mead. The level of water in Lake Mead fluctuates with snowfall in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming. Per the Drought Status Update for California-Nevada | Drought.gov reports as of March 2021, Nevada is in “moderate-to-exceptional drought” and “In Nevada, 100% of the state is in drought, and 40% is in exceptional drought (D4), more area than at any point during the 2012-2016 drought.”  The City of Henderson is in the D4 area.

       "0  Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water.

also heavier rains. Under the higher-emissions scenario, Ohio’s spring rainfall is projected to increase almost 15 percent over the next several decades and about 30 percent toward the end of the century. Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland. The 22,000-acre Emerald Necklace surrounding the metro area has become the region’s catch-basin for storm water runoff. Not only does this cause considerable damages to park properties, the runoff is also accelerating the erosion of hundreds of miles of waterways within the parks system, flushing around 45,000 tons of silt out into Lake Erie each year. Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe. When heavy rain events occur, control devices may allow some of the flow (a combination of stormwater and sewage) to overflow into area waterways to prevent urban flooding and damage to wastewater treatment facilities. These events, or combined sewer overflows (CSOs), have resulted in a consent decree with the EPA.While Cleveland has seen incredible improvement in water quality over the last several decades, increases in precipitation and stormwater runoff pose a significant threat to water quality in the region. As noted above, increases in precipitation have led  to more flooding, combined sewer overflows, and delays in the planting of spring crops, which in turn have resulted in declining water quality in rivers, streams, and storage reservoirs. Some of this is the result of harmful algal blooms forming in the Western basin of Lake Erie, which may have impacts in the Cleveland region if they become too large.Stormwater is a challenge for urban areas and parks in Cleveland.

Southern Nevada Water Authority officials have also been studying and have water rights in Eastern Nevada and will develop a groundwater importation project (pipeline) in the event water levels continue to decline.Water costs are higher due to infrastructure charges used to pay for new water projects, such as the third intake at Lake Mead. Even with conservation efforts, water costs have increased.Water restrictions have led to more conservation; however, if Lake Mead continues to decline, a Federally mandated cut in Southern Nevada's water allocation may occur, and nearly did during the 2015-2016.The City is currently experiencing a 20 year drought. According to climate scientists and SNWA, there is an 80 to 90 percentchance there will be another mutli-decade drought this century due to climate change. This hazard has the immediate effect of a shortfall of water supplies across all Colorado River water users; the long-term effect will also be economic and environmentalDue to the drought, there is less hydro capacity and generation at Hoover and Davis Dams as a result of lower water supplies.SNWA has a finite allotment of water from the Colorado River that is taken from Lake Mead. The level of water in Lake Mead fluctuates with snowfall in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming. Per the Drought Status Update for California-Nevada | Drought.gov reports as of March 2021, Nevada is in “moderate-to-exceptional drought” and “In Nevada, 100% of the state is in drought, and 40% is in exceptional drought (D4), more area than at any point during the 2012-2016 drought.”  The City of Henderson is in the D4 area. The Lake Mead level is currently trending lower than the previous two years.Risk is mitigated by promoting water conservation, creation and adoption of a regional water resource plan (out to 2050), and active participation by SNWA in interstate discussions regarding the future state of the Colorado River System.Our water source, Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, is a high-profile national recreation area. Terrorism or an accidental pollution incident would greatly jeopardize our water supply.

stormwater collection system may be exposed to more extreme and frequent flooding due to the predicted increase in heavy precipitation events, as well as inundation from sea level rise and storm surge. As a result, storm sewers that are at or above capacity may experience more frequent and intense interior flooding. Additionally, the stormwater and combined sewer outfalls that discharge to the Potomac and Anacostia rivers are at low elevations compared to mean sea level. As a result, they will also be susceptible to flooding from sea level rise and storm surge “backing up” through the piped infrastructure which could cause additional flooding in low lying areas.The District's Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment reports that the Districtâ€™s stormwater collection system may be exposed to more extreme and frequent flooding due to the predicted increase in heavy precipitation events, as well as inundation from sea level rise and storm surge.

It is anticipated that drought events will continue in the future and be further exacerbated by climate change. An ongoing reduction in snow pack due to higher average temperatures, which is the primary source of water supply for our region, is a newer risk. Climate models do not agree on the impacts to precipitation, but not having an adequate level of snow is likely to be a substantive challenge in the coming decades.Historically, the Fort Collins water supply has been at risk from wildfire and the often associated flooding. It is anticipated that these types of events will continue in the future and be further exacerbated by climate change.Flooding or runoff from peak rain events canimpact water quality and potentially limit theability to treat drinking water, as evidenced bythe 2013 flood.  Short-term impacts from the flood included increased debris and sediment in Boulder Reservoir, elevatedturbidity levels, and increased concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll a, total organic carbon, andbacteria. Two years’ post-flood, Boulder Reservoir alkalinity, hardness and other water chemistryparameters remained elevated, though concentrations have been returning to pre-flood conditions.Listed 303(d) river and many in similar mountain resort communities and urban areas.Although Longmont currently has secure water rights, we are carefully watching the impacts of climate change on our water supply.Climate change has snow pack and snow melts varying at unpredictable rates not allowing sufficient predictability to help in planning for crop selection and storage projects.Drought increases stress on our water supply and also encourages wildfires throughout the county which contributes to sediment runoff and natural watershed filtration.Flooding, wildfires, and drought are Boulder County's main concerns with severe weather events. The county is decided how much resources to put towards resiliency in preparing for extreme weather events as well as emergency planning for when then events do occur.The water treatment facility is susceptible to power outages that could affect water management.Listed 303(d) river and many in similar mountain resort communities and urban areas.   \n",

19th century. Based on preliminary analyses, several of the Philadelphia Water Department's drinking water and stormwater pumping stations could be vulnerable to flooding under certain scenarios.The public water supplier AquaPA has increased prices as it has taken steps to remove PFAS ground water contaminants throughout its service area including parts of Abington Township.Severe or increased stormwater and flooding events as previously described in the Township's Hazard Risk and Mitigation Plan are of serious concern throughout the Township.Unknown as this has not been formally assessed in a climate mitigation plan.Severe drought has placed water restrictions on our community. There is a de facto moratorium on most new buildings.Pittsburgh struggles with combined sewer overflows, and a tenth of an inch of rain releases raw sewage into the rivers. There are also aging railroad tracks along all of the rivers with trains carrying hazardous and toxic materials. If a train derails, it could contaminate the waterOil/gas spills, fracking fluids, development around the Susquehanna River Water Basin.High maintenance, collapsing pipes, frequent flushing.Pittsburgh's geography and impervious surfaces have caused fatal flash floods. River flooding is controlled by the aging lock and dam system, and a failure to an upstream lock and dam would flood downtown.   \n",

   An increasing population coupled with increasing severity of drought is increasing water stress.Park City meets the water needs of the community from ground water (underground water fed by snowpack), and imported surface water. The majority of our sources are ground water sources. These include the Judge Tunnel, Spiro Tunnel, Park Meadows Well, Divide Well, and Middle School Well. The increased likelihood of low-snow years could put stress on one of these water sources.A winter drought resulting in a low-snow year has immediate economic and social impacts. This year Park City area is experiencing water stress due to drought.More rain, less snow, aging drainage systems, may lead to flooding and impacted water quality. Storm water is not treated prior to entering streams, rivers, and eventually the Great Salt Lake.extended drought decreasing reliability of water supplies, some residents already facing cutbacks of water supplyMore rain, less snow, aging drainage systems, may lead to flooding and impacted water quality.

Some areas of natural and semi-natural vegetation remain (Figure 2-8). concentrated along the Mississippi River and in the north end of the District near Lake McCarrons... In addition to development, impacts from habitat fragmentation, hydrologic alteration, and pollutant loading may promote non-native or invasive species,reduce habitat, and diminish filtration, infiltration, and water retention benefits that these natural areas provide. \"It's a priority of the Capitol Region Watershed District, per their 2021-2030 management plan - to better research the prevalence, extent and impacts of emerging water quality issues, including microplastics and PFAS - (page 44) -  https://www.capitolregionwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CRWD_WatershedManagementPlan_BWSR-Submittal_Full_reduced.pdfSPRWS 2020 Water Qualty Report - https://www.stpaul.gov/sites/default/files/Media%20Root/Water%20Services/WaterQualityReport.pdfMinnesota Department of Health has also released studies on PFAS in Minnesota groundwater - https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/hazardous/topics/pfcs.htmlWinona's water source is naturally high in radium, which is radioactive and regulated by state and federal authorities.

       "      <td>Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021).

In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The Cityâ€™s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2016-2017, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2016-2017, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of fresh water. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%.  Through the Cityâ€™s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City was able to reduce its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life.  A report issued in February 2018 by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, showed that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash and other pollutants are deposited on our roadways and into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean through our storm drains, by rain, and other runoff water. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for storm water runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years. Although, the drought was officially declared over in 2017.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts</td>\n",

       "CA     Historic drought; although the state-wide California drought from 2014 to 2017 was recently declared over, the City anticipates being affected by future droughts. The California Governor has declared a drought for some areas of California in 2021. Although LA is not included, our water storage is dependent on future rainfall, which is not guaranteed. LA    is continuing public education and outreach on water conservation as a new way of life.About one-fifth of the city's water pipes were installed before 1931 and nearly all will reach the end of their useful lives in the next 15 years. The Department of Water and Power (DWP) has assigned letter grades to water main pipes to prioritize replacement in the city’s 6,730-mile network. The Department is upgrading water infrastructure as part of a $6.3 billion five-year Water System capital plan (per DWP's 2017-2018 Water Infrastructure Plan) and has replaced 112 miles of old mainline pipe from January 2018 to June 2021 so far.Over the past 120 years, California has become increasingly dry. The most recent drought from 2012 to 2016 was the most extreme since instrumental records began. Drought decreases the availability and quality of water for humans. This includes reduced water levels to fight wildfires. Drought may increase exposure to health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, land subsidence, increased water pollution, erosion, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity, degradation of watersheds, and alteration of ecosystems and loss of habitat. It can also lead to the emergence of new contagious and vector-borne disease. Our county is now again in drought conditions, and the Santa Clara Valley District has announced mandatory water restrictions, aiming for a 15% reduction in system-wide consumption compared to 2019. Retailers have increased outreach on water saving practices and materials in an effort to meet that goal.California has a history of droughts affecting water security throughout the state and record-warm temperatures caused by climate change have continued to exacerbate the drought.The state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply. As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s utility, East Bay Municipal Utility District declared a stage 4 drought. Temporary drought surcharges of up to 25% on water flow charges and excessive water use penalty went into effect in 2015. Both regulations were lifted in 2016.The City's water utility has no tiered pricing, a strategy that could be pivotal for conserving water. The State of California also has antiquated water right laws that allow for excessive water use.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Statewide drought. Although California experienced record precipitation during the winter of 2018-2019, the repercussions of the State's multi-year drought will continue to impact water resources in the future.Prices have increased due to drought.With substantial new residential and commercial construction, demand on water resources during the construction phase has increased in the short term, straining an already limited water supply that has barely recovered from drought conditions.During the most recent historic drought in California, the  local water utility placed a drought surcharge on retail water prices. After the drought had been declared over, this surcharge was memorialized as a permanent rate increase.From 2011 to 2017, California experienced its worst drought in 54 years. The drought was worsened by the effects of climate change reducing the Sierra snowpack, a vital stockpile of freshwater. In 2015, the Governor issued Executive Order B-29-15, proclaiming a continued state of emergency due to the ongoing drought, and mandated that all Californians collectively reduce their potable water use by 25%. Later rules by the State Water Resources Control Board required the city to reduce its 2013 baseline use of potable water by 16%. Through the City’s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City reduced its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state, and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, issued a report issued in February 2018 showing that 44% of the state, including Los Angeles County where Culver City resides, is now considered to be in a moderate drought.Rain and other runoff deposit dangerous bacteria, pesticides, toxic chemicals, oil and grease, trash, and other pollutants from our roadways, through our storm drains, into Ballona Creek, Marina del Rey Harbor, and the ocean. These pollutants harm fish and wildlife, cause illness and infections for swimmers and surfers, and make beaches unsafe. The State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards have implemented very strict pollution reduction regulations for stormwater runoff. These regulations require Culver City to develop and implement programs to reduce and prevent water pollution.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Piedmont continues to experience Level 4 drought severity.The availability of local and imported surface water may be vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns, as well as rising temperatures, which increases evaporation from surface waters and evapotranspiration that reduces infiltration and natural recharge to the local aquifers. Local and imported water availability may also be impacted by droughts, which may become more frequent and severe. Future droughts have been identified as our primary water supply challenge, as water supplies may be insufficient to meet Valley Water’s level of service goal. Valley Water. (2021). Draft Climate Change Action Plan. https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/Updated%20CCAP%20Draft%2003_2021.pdfOur County's largest surface water reservoir - Anderson Reservoir is out of service for a seismic retrofit. In a statement, Valley Water Board Chair Tony Estremera said \"we know our largest drinking water reservoir will be out of service for 10 years. If the drought continues into next year, we could face the possibility there will not be enough water to meet basic demands without serious risk of subsidence in 2022.\" (Estremera, 2021: https://www.valleywater.org/drought)The State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa. Lake Herman has historically been used as an emergency water supply and temporary storage reservoir.  The City has 3,100 acre-feet of reliable water supply and has purchased water from various agencies when needed. Allocations of water from the SWP have varied from 5% to 65%. When the allocation exceeded 35%, then the City had adequate water supply. Some of the SWP and SP water that is allocated and not used can be carried over or \"banked\" for use in future years. Approximately 10,000 acre-feet of water has been \"banked\" in Lake Berryessa for use during a drought.  Reservoir storage is low - Lake Oroville is at 66% of Historical Average; Lake Berryessa is at lowest in 22 years, 76% of average.With the population increasing and the AG industry progressively growing, there is a need to monitor water levels for efficient useThe state of California is recovering from a serious four year drought, which required exceptional water conservation measures to address the impacts of a limited snowpack and unsustainably depleted groundwater supply.

Both regulations were lifted in 2016.California is recovering from an unprecedented drought, and water resources are increasingly scarce at a regional scale.  Increased efforts to conserve and reuse water will be necessary in the coming years.  West Hollywood receives water from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as well as from Beverly Hills Water.See above.Prices have increased due to drought.The City's water supplier, East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) has a degrading infrastructure. Much of the pipelines used to deliver water are decades old. EBMUD may hike up water rates to pay for capital investments.Serious concern in localized portions of city from creek flooding and from sea level riseDrought risk already impendingThe State Water Project (SWP) has historically supplied 75% to 85% of the City's water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and the Solano Project (SP) has historically supplied 15% to 25% of the City's water from Lake Berryessa.

As a result of the drought, communities were left with limited access to water and forest and land fires increased in frequency and severity.The City’s current potable water supply is highly vulnerable to drought. During extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality. Drought will cause regional water demand likely to spike due to irrigation demand and increased evaporation losses. Secondary impact of elevated fire risk may increase water demand for fire suppression.The greatest potential impact of sea level rise on local water service will occur in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sea level rise will increase salinity in the Delta leading to saline intrusion contaminating deep aquifers that provide current potable water and aquifers that provide emergency potable water. Secondly, during extended drought EBMUD’s regional water system may be inadequate to supply Richmond, and may suffer decline in quality.California has been experiencing historic levels of drought and while 2015/2016 was an El Nino year that helped alleviate some of the previous years of dryness, it looks like water shortage will be very common throughout the coming years.Deferred maintenance on water systemHistoric drought; although drought recently ended the City anticipates future droughts   \n",
